# Photo Duplicate Finder

I'm in the processing of moving off gsuite, onto icloud, because it is cheaper, and not google. When you download your
google photos via takeout, they can be duplicated if they are part of one ore more albums. My aim here is to make a tool
that traverses through the directory you pass it, generating a file that tells you where all the duplicates are. I'll
probabl follow up with a script, or another program to remove one of the duplicates, but that will require a bit more thought,
as to which one to remove.
